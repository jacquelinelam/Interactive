  	<h1>Midterm Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Brainstormed ideas:</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Favorite old school video game or favorite mobile/tablet game: </li>
          <ul>
            <li>e.g. Flappy Bird, <a href https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3LrvnQ8x84>Retro-shifter</a>, Maze Runner, Jumpdash by chipset </li>
          </ul>
        <li>Features to be included ( e.g. leveling, artwork, a compelling user interface, sounds, etc): </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Parallax Scrolling: foreground/ background - to create illusion of moving</li>
            <li>Collisions (character)</li>
            <li>Artwork- gif background?</li>
            <li>Our choice of system that lets the user construct their own works of art</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2> Final Decision: </h2>
    <p>
      <b>Why we choose to pursue this project: </b>We really like the sci-fi futuristic theme inspired by the movies listed below. In addition, we wanted to design a game that is similar to Flappy Bird where the background constantly moves and makes the user to look like he/she is constantly moving forward while avoiding obstacles like laser bullet or cyborgs or flying cars. We want the game to be an endless running game where the user must collect as many guns/ batteries. However, the game should end when the user comes into contact with the barriers (flying cars/ bullet/ cyborgs) too many times (e.g. 5 times) and loses his/ her life.
      <br>
      <b> Name:</b> Cyber Punk Endless Runner
      <br>
      <b> Setting:</b> 2045 Dystopian Tokyo
      <br>
      <b> Storyline:</b> Set in the dystopian future where Artificial Intelligence and Cyborgs are a reality. Currently, underground rebellion movements are rising to subvert the inhumane ways that cyborgs are subjected to. They are claiming their own rights as humans.
      Our main character Kouki (meaning hope, goodness) is a cyborg that has to fight the government Mercenary cyborgs that have found out his intentions to overthrow the government. He has to dodge energy bullets from the other cyborgs as well as flying cars, etc. But he is endlessly running.
      <br>
      <b>Inspiration:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Film/ TV: Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, Altered Carbon </li>
        <li> Games: Street Fighter, Into Mirror, Retro Shifter, Maze Runner </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Background of the Game: </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>requires parallax scrolling, as we want to paint different layers (gif originally from artist WANEELA, edited by Sophia Wang)
          <br> <img src="background.gif"> </li>
        <li>background, flying cars, character who is constantly 'running', evil cyborgs</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>Features:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Leveling:</b>perhaps 1-2 levels where there will be less/ more obstacles to avoid</li>
        <li> <b> Artwork: </b> gif background, other images should be animated, slightly japanese sci-fi theme related </li>
        <li> <b> User Interface:</b>space bar for jumping and down arrow/ key S for dodging </li>
        <li> <b> Sound Effect: </b>sci-fi futuristic/ electronic music; sound effects for dodge/ hit/ score</li>
        <li> <b> Objects: </b>  [objectives:] guns, batteries; [barriers:] flying cars, cyborgs</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
